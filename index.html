                    <h3>Deepfake - Detection using MesoNet</h3>
                    <h4>Feb 2024 - April 2024</h4>
                    <p>This model utilizes the MesoNet architecture, a convolutional 
                        neural network (CNN), optimized for identifying manipulated 
                        images and videos. By fine-tuning the pretrained MesoNet model 
                        on a diverse dataset containing real and deepfake content, the 
                        model demonstrates robustness and accuracy in distinguishing 
                        between authentic and synthetic media. This approach 
                        empowers us to combat the proliferation of manipulated content 
                        and uphold the integrity of visual media across various domains.

                    <h3>Accident Severity Prediction</h3>
                    <h4>Sep 2023 - Dec 2023</h4>
                    <p>This project involves developing a Machine Learning model for 
                        predicting accident severity based on various factors. The model 
                        analyzes and detects the severity of damage caused in specific 
                        accidents and can also be used to predict the likelihood of future 
                        accidents by applying different scenarios. The model was built using the 
                        US Accident Dataset (2016-2023), which includes 33 featuresâ€”comprising 
                        one target variable (accident severity) and multiple independent variables. 
                        Key technologies and methodologies used in this project include Data 
                        Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, and Model 
                        Evaluation. The model leverages Supervised Learning Algorithms to 
                        ensure accurate predictions and was implemented using Python with 
                        libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow. Data Visualization 
                        techniques were employed to explore and understand the data, while 
                        Hyperparameter Tuning was used to optimize model performance. The 
                        project also involved Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
                        to ensure high-quality input data for the model.

                    <h3>Fraud Transaction Detection</h3>
                    <h4>May 2024</h4>
                    <p>This model is responsible for detecting fraudulent transactions. In this 
                        model, I have utilized a fraud transaction dataset which consists of 11 
                        attributes and around 7 million rows. After performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) including Statistical 
                        Analysis and data cleaning/wrangling on the dataset, I applied 
                        SMOTE technique to balance the dataset, since the target variable was 
                        highly imbalanced. After splitting the dataset into training 
                        and testing data, I applied various models such as XGBClassifier, 
                        Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression. 
                        Finally, I applied data visualization to analyze model 
                        performance and compared the results.  
                        The best performance was achieved in the XGBClassifier model.</p>
